= Arquillian GlassFish 6 Container Integration

This is an initial port of the GlassFish 5 and earlier Arquillian container integrations to
GlassFish 6, which builds on the Jakarta EE 9 APIs. Jakarta EE 9 switched the based API package namespace from javax.*
to jakarta.*, introducing a source and binary incompatibility with previous versions of Java EE and Jakarta EE 8.

Because of this, the GlassFish container integration for 6.x and later has been broken out into a new
project.

== Building

Build using the staging profile to pull in the staged but unreleased Jakarta dependencies:

`mvn -Pstaging install`

== TODO
The GlassFish 5.x and earlier version had support for an embedded version of the container integration.
Those APIs have changed significantly and the embedded container support still needs to be updated
for GlassFish 6.x.
